         <h2>Anne Mark</h2>
         <p>With Michelle's help, we were able to increase the functionality of our website dramatically while cutting our costs. Our website is much more easy to use, has tons of more features than before and is incredibly easy to maintain. We could not be more happy with our new website! Thanks Michelle!</p>

        <h2>Susan Wells</h2>
        <p>I am pleased we are with the web site you designed for us. The district needed a site that addressed varied aspects of our operation. You have met those needs and then some! We have had nothing but rave comments about the site from those who are closest to it and rely on it the most. Thank you Michelle</p>
